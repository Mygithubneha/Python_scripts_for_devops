# What the Script Does

The script updates a specific configuration setting in a server configuration file. In this case, it updates the value for the MAX_CONNECTIONS setting in a file called server.conf.


# Purpose: The script changes the value of a specific setting in a configuration file.

Steps:

-Read the file: Opens the configuration file and reads all its lines.

-Modify the content: Goes through each line, and if it finds the setting you want to change, it updates its value.

-Write back to the file: Writes all lines back to the file, with the specified setting updated.

Example: If the file contains MAX_CONNECTIONS=100, after running the script, it will contain MAX_CONNECTIONS=600.

This script automates the process of updating configuration settings in a file, which can be very useful for system administrators and developers who need to make consistent changes to configuration files.
